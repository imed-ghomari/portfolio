Developed a budget impact model for a rare disease treatment (e.g. burosumab).

### Key Contributions:
- Identified epidemiological parameters, treatment displacement assumptions, and cost drivers.
- Reflected critically on sourcing upper/lower bounds via systematic literature reviews (SLRs) while avoiding outlier bias.
- Built structured sensitivity analysis tables with source traceability.
