Create richly structured tasks from a single natural language line. SuperAdd recognizes your custom properties, applies templates, and writes clean frontmatter with correct ordering.

### Highlights:
- **Natural language parsing** for title, tags, time estimate, due date/time, and recurrence.
- **Custom properties** (string, number, boolean, array, date) recognized inline by name or value.
- **Template support** with frontmatter merge, maintaining your preferred property order.
- **Live preview** with pill-style property display for immediate feedback.
- **Quick link insertion** using a dedicated file picker for seamless `[[links]]`.
