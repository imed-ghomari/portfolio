## Micro-Costing Study in Breast Cancer Management

- Conducted a detailed micro-costing analysis to estimate total average costs of breast cancer patient management.
- Worked at population, patient, and procedure levels.
- Addressed missing data using imputation techniques implemented in Python.
- Designed sensitivity analyses (including tornado diagrams) with cost categories such as inpatient care, surgery, radiotherapy, outpatient visits, diagnostics, and travel.
- Focused on methodological rigor suitable for publication.

## Budget Impact Model (BIM) for Rare Disease Treatment

- Developed a budget impact model for a rare disease treatment (e.g. burosumab).
- Identified epidemiological parameters, treatment displacement assumptions, and cost drivers.
- Reflected critically on sourcing upper/lower bounds via systematic literature reviews (SLRs) while avoiding outlier bias.
- Built structured sensitivity analysis tables with source traceability.

# **Digital Coordinator at Infusion Digitale**:

Managed digital coordination, building on experience from roles at Roche, Pfizer, and Rouiba Hospital.

## Personal projects

### Cross-Device Media Consumption System (Desktop → Android)

- Designed a personal media workflow where playback progress, consumption state, and ordering are stored in structured JSON.
- Synced media files and metadata across devices using Syncthing.
- Explored interoperability with existing Android players vs. building a custom player.
- Evaluated ExoPlayer, Video.js, PyVidPlayer2, and Kivy-based Android packaging with performance and format-support trade-offs.

### Desktop Media Player Application

- Built a desktop application to manage long-form video consumption.
- Features include:
  - Directory-based media ingestion
  - Persistent playback position
  - “Consumed / not consumed” tracking
  - Ordering and cleanup of completed content
- Iteratively improved UI/UX with focus on minimalism and professional layout.

### Structured Personal Improvement Framework - **Roadmap to Janna**:

- A GitHub project providing a step-by-step system for success in Muslim life, including an integrated Obsidian vault for personal knowledge management and religious practices.
- Designed a multi-initiative system to improve character traits, worship consistency, and personal discipline.
- Each initiative tracked via structured properties (e.g. good traits, bad traits, worship actions).
- Quantified progress using percentages and score aggregation.
- Explored gamification mechanics (levels, thresholds, trend tracking).
